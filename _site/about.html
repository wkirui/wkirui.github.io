    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I work with data systems. Often helping to build tools for data collection, analysis and reporting.
        This is a personal project to share some of the thoughts and to take notes on different tools that I will be using.
        I mostly use Python in day-to-day data operations. Mostly pandas, numpy, geopandas, and sklearn for ML.
