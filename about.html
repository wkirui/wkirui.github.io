        <h4>About Myself</h4>
        <p>I work with data systems. Often helping to build tools for data collection, analysis and reporting.<br>
            This is a personal project to share some of the thoughts and to take notes on different tools that I will be using.
            I mostly use Python in day-to-day data operations. Mostly pandas, numpy, geopandas, and sklearn for ML.
