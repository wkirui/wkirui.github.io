## Introduction
This is a look at machine learning model.
I this project I used the data from the inside Airbnb project to analyze the trends in prices and create a machine learning model that can be used to predict the prices for that apartment.
For instance with this model, one visiting Berlin might have a good sense of the prices in the given borough or residents can also use the algorithm to optimize performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
## Conclusion
In this analysis, we looked at how our model performs given a set of features. Now we can perform further tweaks by adjusting the features as well as changing the algorithm performance. We can trying using XGBoost to see how the model performs or use other regression techniques. I will also be using PCA analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data and make the model more generalizable.
